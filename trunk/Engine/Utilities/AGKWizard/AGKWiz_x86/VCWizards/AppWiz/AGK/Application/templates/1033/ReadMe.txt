    AGK Wizard : "[!output PROJECT_NAME]" Project Overview
===============================================================================

AGK Wizard has created this "[!output PROJECT_NAME]" project for you as a
starting point.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your project.

AGK Wizard.vcproj
    This is the main project file for projects generated using an Application
    Wizard. It contains information about the version of the product that
    generated the file, and information about the platforms, configurations,
    and project features selected with the Application Wizard.

Core.cpp/CoreForApp.h
    These are the AGK core files that must be included in every AGK app. They
    contain the app definition and entry point.
    
Main.cpp/Main.h
    These contain a basic framework consisting of a startup function, a loop
    function and an end function. They should be modified to suit.
